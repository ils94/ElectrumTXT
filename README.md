Electrum on Android does not allow you to create a .txt file containing your transaction (TX) string; it only allows you to either copy the string or share it through an intent. I created this app as an extension to enable users to quickly create a .txt file containing the TX string and save it in the device's memory or even on an SD card/pendrive. This allows you to transport your TX string to another device that contains your offline Bitcoin wallet for signing and later broadcasting.

You can download the app from this link: https://github.com/ils94/ElectrumTXT/releases/download/release/ElectrumTXT.apk

Do not download my app anywhere else besides my repository. Or download the code and compile it yourself.
